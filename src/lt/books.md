# Books

Books have had a large influence on my life. When I was young my dad made the value of reading clear to me. While reading was always something I did for fun, it was during college that reading started to feel transformative.

Unlike most, I organize the physical bookshelf in my house in the order I read the books, and here is the narrative I hold in my head as reflect upon what I've read and how it's influnced my life.

## Before College

Before getting to college I was reading mostly for fun or because I had to from school. I enjoyed reading 
- Harry Potter
- The Series of Unfortunate Events
- The Giver
- Percy Jackson trilogy
- 1984

## College

Interestingly for Rutgers BS CS there was no required reading. And I was pretty hungry to learn about the world. I discovered a love for programming at an early age but I sorta built whatever the first idea that popped into my head was. I met one of my dad's friends who was tangentially involved in a high frequency trading firm. Until this point I believed that most programmers were just making Android and iOS apps. He recommended I read *Flash Boys* which began my first serious foray into reading non-fiction.

* Flash Boys
* Zero to One
* Lean Startup
* Crossing the Chasm
* Economics in One Lesson
* The Innovator's Dilemma
* Black Swan
* Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products
* Fahrenheit 451
* The Big Short

At the time I was an intern at SAP, a pretty large software company (comparable to Oracle in lots of ways) and I was working on a Robotics oriented startup. I was hungry to learn the processs of novel-value creation and spent a lot of time reflecting on what *human progress* actually means. As I generally gained confidence in myself I was actively trying to determine where I wanted my career to head. Did I want to try to be an entrepreneur? An academic? A politician? A highly paid software engineer?
I started to form the desire to zoom out and understand the bigger picture more deeply, I think this desire was probably sparked after reading Black Swan.
Towards year 3 & 4 of college it seemed like political tensions were also on the rise, and as far as I can tell, henceforth it's always felt that way. I wonder, has it just always been that way, and it's just my awareness that's changing. Anyways I also wanted to *be good* in the grand scheme of things and I was humble enough to know that it's not clear how to do that. 
I was open to utilitarian ideas of effective altruism, spritiual ideas of just being the best version of yourself, and
