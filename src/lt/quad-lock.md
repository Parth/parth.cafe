I used to do no case for a long time, but motorcycling, wrenching, and skiing require cases and phones. In many cases a phone is a safety critical object, and in many activities it's an essential source of information. If you're a key figure for a company or a family it's your responsibility to be reliably reachable. 

I think Quad Lock is the best case I've found due to it's supplemental utility.

I generally have the case, but when I'm more irresponsible I'll sitck the [Universal Adapter](https://www.quadlockcase.com/collections/accessories/products/universal-adapter) on the back. I trust the adhesives.

Half of the time my ipad mini has [a quad lock case](https://www.quadlockcase.com/collections/accessories/products/folio-ipad) as well. Bringing magsafe to my iPad. This is mostly an experiment to see how it feels to have a massive screen in the context of [adventure biking](../wrenching/crf300l.md) or [my truck](../wrenching/f150.md).

Both motorcycles have [wireless charging heads](https://www.quadlockcase.com/collections/accessories/products/cycle-waterproof-wireless-charging-head) which is kinda essential for rain based nav on long trips. Although my current setup has skill issues which make it unreliable. This will be fixed and documented soon.

The [arm band](https://www.quadlockcase.com/collections/accessories/products/replacement-armband-strap) is nice for running and working around the house.

I am experimenting with the [tripod adapter](https://www.quadlockcase.com/products/tripod-adaptor?srsltid=AfmBOorJgz_Gut2Vm7sA10PF3E2nHMHYNTB_IRq8UmSgGsdzObVEnLs7) for a B cam.

Also the [ring](https://www.quadlockcase.com/collections/accessories/products/phone-ring-stand) for maybe the most secure way to caribiner a phone to something (tbd) and it's kinda nice to have a 0 cost kick stand and more secure grip on the phone. I just wonder if it's a good way to break or injure a fingure. I also don't want to deal with it whne I need it off (like when I'm in motorcycle gear).
