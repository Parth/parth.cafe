Listed here are things that have been working well for some while. If something's missing I just don't have a solution that I think feels good.

# Versatile

	- Despite their name I've ripped quite a lot of Carhartt Ripstop workpants, so I'm trying these amazon basic ones. The fit is still a bit large on me (despite getting their smallest size), and so I am also experimenting with suspenders.
