# Wrenching Levels
I love working with my hands, and increasing my ability to take on more ambitious projects has been one of the most rewarding things I've done over the last 2 decades. Similar to [swimming levels](../lt/swimming-levels.md), I think it can be helpful to share the significant growth moments that I encountered as I developed myself. Naturally working with your hands is a vast space, so this document focuses on the ideas specific to maintaining machinery. This also tracks how I envision my growth continuing

Presently I reached Level 5 and aspire to reach Level 6 using the [miata](miata/taking-stock-of-our-purchase.md) as an educational platform.
