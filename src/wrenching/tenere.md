Picked up from Logan from a storage location in Saratoga Springs. Battery a litle low on pickup, and there's damage on the headlights. Apart from that it's in great condition. Pretty surprised I was able to grab this 25 version with new suspension and throttle tech for so cheap.

Am in search for most of the fun the CRF has given me, and also more comfort on the highway.
