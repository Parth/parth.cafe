# 1-23-26
Picked up from Logan Davis from a storage location in Saratoga Springs. Battery a litle low on pickup, and there's damage on the headlights. Apart from that it's in great condition. Pretty surprised I was able to grab this 25 version with new suspension and throttle tech for $8500 (kinda).

Am in search for most of the fun the CRF has given me, and also more comfort on the highway. 

VIN: `JYADM17E3SA002055`

Originally purchased by Logan Davis, for $13,108.18 at GT-Toys. There was a Lien on the title, and also a lien release from Community Bank. Origially DMV said it needed to be notarized, but dmv's site and a revisit prooved that to not be needed. There is a Lifetime Engine Limited Warranty by from "GT Toyz", their stock number is `Y25MC141`. On this page the vehicle price seems to be $15,552.60, perhaps this was what this was initially listed at. There is also a factory waranty that expires in 7/26/26.
