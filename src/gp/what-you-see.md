# How do you see the world

I've been giving a lot of thought to the various ways people view problems and solutions, particularly: how does _what you spend most of your time doing_ map to the way you view the world? For example, people who spend a lot of time thinking about marketing and sales may have the following perspective: all the problems and solutions are out there; the hard part is creating a narrative that connects the dots. On the other hand, I would wager that people in finance see things in terms of accurate pricing, forecasting, and resource allocation.

Of course, the thing that influences your perspective doesn't have to be tied to your profession (or any profession for that matter), but it likely does need to be tied to whatever you're putting your [10,000 hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)) into. I think this starts to happen somewhere around the time you consider the _thing_ to be a central part of your identity. It's likely tied to the point where you start to form your own opinions using expertise and specific knowledge that other people don't have. At this point, you're in a position to contribute something novel back, hopefully something of value.

Personally, I'm very interested in putting my 10,000 hours towards advancing the state of technology. I find advancing technology (particularly writing software) to be intrinsically rewarding, I'd happily do this in a vacuum. However we're not a vacuum, and while every problem is not technical in nature, I see many that are.

Now, I haven't crossed hour 10,000 yet, but I'm ready to start sharing my ideas and the way I think about certain things. I've learned a lot so far and I've formed a more clear idea of the type of technology I'm interested in advancing: technology that empowers **the individual.**

I want to use this blog to detail the things I'm exploring, share what I value and the potential I see in the future.
