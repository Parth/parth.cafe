# Hi!

I'm Parth, and this is the public component of my [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/). 

I'm a programmer with many interests, but I'm primarily working on my startup [Lockbook](https://lockbook.net).

In the **General Programming** section you can find some abstract ideas about building products, my latest position various programming topics, and other areas of exploration.

**Lockbook** is secure note taking platform. If you'd like to learn more about it checkout [our website](https://lockbook.net). There you can learn more about the product, see some live demos, and dive deeper into Lockbook's product documentation. The **Lockbook** section here captures some of the aspects of the project I'm most proud to have contributed.

I like working with my hands, the **wrenching** section catalogues my journey with various motorcycles, my project miata, and various other physical world pursuits.

Finally **Life Tracking** is a place I can share things like what books I'm reading, how I organize my spaces, and anything else that's captured my interest.

 This whole site is literally just a folder in my Lockbook that I edit as I experience existence. A tiny [Github Actions](https://github.com/Parth/parth.cafe/tree/master/.github/workflows) script builds an [MdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) and publishes it to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
