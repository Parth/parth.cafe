# Hi

I'm Parth, and this is the public component of my second brain. I'm a programmer who enjoys many hobbies, but I'm primarily working on my startup [Lockbook](https://lockbook.net). This site is powered by Lockbook, [Github Actions](https://github.com/Parth/parth.cafe/tree/master/.github/workflows), and [MdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

In the **General Programming** section you can find some abstract ideas about building products, my latest position various programming topics, and other areas of exploration.

**Lockbook** is secure note taking platform. If you'd like to learn more about it checkout [our website](https://lockbook.net). There you can learn more about the product, see some live demos, and dive deeper into Lockbook's product documentation. The **Lockbook** section here captures some of the aspects of the project I'm most proud to have contributed.
