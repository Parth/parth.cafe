I'm Parth. I'm working full-time on lockbook.net.\n","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/","title":"Home"},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/autocross2023/":{"body":"Autocross\nLast season I raced the Miata, twice! I had a lot of fun and learned a great deal.\n\nIf Formula 1 racing is the top rung of motorsports, autocross is probably at the bottom. Autocross is generally hosted in a parking lot and the track is defined by cones. The format of the \"race\" is a time trial, one car is sent out at a time and the fastest time wins. You receive a time penalty for each cone you hit.\nAutocross is one of the most accessible forms of racing. You can show up with just about any car, and compete against people in similar cars. The course setup and generally low overall speed minimize the chance of property damage.\nThis event is hosted by BMW CCA, and the classifications, as a result, are amusing: all non-BMW cars are in the same class. As a result, our Miata is in the same class as this open-wheel racecar:\n\nNor does the Miata qualify for any points, but about 50% of the cars there weren't BMWs, because racing cars is fun as hell.\nI did two sessions to understand how our bone stock car stacks up. In Autocross the most competitive mods are generally great tires and suspension. The Miata does come with a reasonably competitive suspension from the factory. The suspension design: a double wishbone suspension is generally something you find on high-end sports cars.\n\nSo that's good, but our suspension is 27 years old, and if you look closely much of the rubber boot is frayed:\n\nThere are other pretty \"tired\" components like our bushings that are likely holding us back as well.\nThe tires we're running are also possibly the worst tires for this setting. They're all-weather hard-compound tires that are pretty practical for life as a daily car. But it is very impractical for racing cars around a parking lot (a very practical activity).\n\nBut nonetheless, Autocross is a very welcoming environment so I gave it a shot.\nThis event is particularly lax in the way that they don't require convertibles to install a roll cage. Tech-inspection is primarily an individual responsibility which is genuinely rare in motorsports. With the setup of this event, I also got to bring a buddy who could drive the Miata without reducing any of my seat time. For the first session, I brought my Dad who very quickly discovered that racing seats are uncomfortable. And the second time I brought my best friend Travis who took a handful of these photos.\nQuickly after arriving you realize that not only will you be driving your car, but you'll also be a volunteer for running the event. Volunteers run out onto the course to fix downed cones and report when cars go off track. It's not always clear where the cone goes...\n\nEven at low speeds the process of trying to improve your time lap after lap is quite fun. It rapidly becomes an exercise in memory, if you're thinking about where to go you're probably not doing as well as you could. Hesitation at the limit of traction probably means you're going to hit a cone or go off track. A few cones were destroyed by me:\n\nBetween the first and second sessions, I installed a bunch of telemetry in the car, to better understand how I'm doing, but also give me some time between sessions to try to remember the track better:\nTODO VIDEO\nAfter the event concludes race results are released: https://www.njbmwcca.org/event_info/results/autox_20231008_fin.htm. During our second, we completed 47th overall with 60 total contestants. And within our (relatively meaningless) class we were 30th out of 37th.\nIt's fascinating to see how all these cars stack up, and something I found particularly inspiring is that the value of our car is probably one of the lowest in the event overall, and the first session was won overall by a Miata.\nIt was also fascinating to see the incredible variety of cars at the event:\nThere were some dedicated, prepped, exotic track cars:\n\nSome expensive cars:\n\n\nSome unsuspecting stuff:\n\nAnd some adorable stuff:\n\nOverall I had a blast and I look forward to bringing more of my buddies to this eclectic weekend event, building the car, and building my skills up.\nWhat's next for the car, is as expected: fresh tires, and fresh suspension. Before the next event, this is what we'll be taking care of.\n","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/autocross2023/","title":"Autocross 2023"},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/core/":{"body":"Why Lockbook chose Rust\nLockbook&nbsp;began it’s&nbsp;journey&nbsp;as a bash script. As it started to evolve into something more serious, one of our earliest challenges was identifying a UI framework we were willing to bet on. As we explored, we were weighing things like UI quality, developer experience, language selections, and so on.\nOur choice of UI framework had implications for our server as well. If we chose JavaFX and native Android, we would likely want to choose a JVM-based language for our server to share as much code as possible.&nbsp;\nAs we wrote and re-wrote our application, we discovered that most of our effort, even on our clients, was not front-end code. When we were implementing user management, billing, file operations, collaboration, compression, and encryption, the lion’s share of the work was around traditional backend-oriented tasks. Things like data modeling, error propagation, managing complex logic, handling database interactions, and writing tests were where we were spending most of our time. Many of these things had to take place on our clients because all our user data is&nbsp;end-to-end-encrypted. Additionally, some of these operations were sensitive to slight differences in implementation. If your encryption and decryption are subtly different across two different clients, your file may be unreadable.\nIt was also becoming clear to us that the applications that looked and felt the best to us were created in that platform’s native UI framework. So our initial investigation around UI frameworks morphed into an inquiry into what the best repository for business logic was. Ideally, this repository would give us great tools for writing complex business logic and would be ultimately portable.\nTools for managing complexity\nOur collective experience made us gravitate towards a particular spirit. At&nbsp;Gemini,&nbsp;Raayan&nbsp;and I saw how productive we were within a foreign, large-scale, Scala codebase. Informed by the experience we were looking for a language with an expressive, robust type system.\nA “robust type system” goes beyond what you’d find in languages like Java, Python, or Go. We were looking for type systems where null or nil were the exception, rather than the norm. We want it to be apparent when a function could return an error, or an empty value, and have ergonomic ways to handle those scenarios.\nWe wanted to have sophisticated interactions with things like enums, specifically, we wanted to be able to model the idea of exhaustivity. When an idea we were working with evolved to have more&nbsp;cases&nbsp;we wanted our compiler to guide us to all the locations that need to be updated.\nThere were a handful of other features we were looking for which can broadly be categorized into two similar ideas:&nbsp;\nWe wanted to express as much as we could in our primary programming language. Things that would traditionally be documented (this fn will return null in this situation) or things that would be expressed in configuration (TLS configuration handled by a different program in YAML) would ideally be expressed in a language that contributors understood intimately. Ideally in a language where the compiler was providing strong guarantees against mistakes and misuse.\nWe wanted our language and tools to help us detect defects as&nbsp;early as possible&nbsp;in the development lifecycle. Most software developers are used to trying to capture defects at test time, but we found that trying to capture defects even earlier, at compile time, allowed us to drop into&nbsp;flow&nbsp;more easily. The following is our preference for when we’d like to catch defects:\n\nat compile time\ntest time\nstartup time\npr time\ninternal test time\nby a customer\n\nOur strongest contenders for languages here were Rust, Haskell, and Scala.\nUltra-portability\nIdeally, this repository would not place constraints on where it could be used. If our repository was in Scala, for instance, we’d be able to use it on Desktop, our Server, and Android, but we’d run into problems on Apple devices.\nWe could use something like JS, virtually every platform has a way to invoke some sort of WebView which allows you to execute JS. But we’d had plenty of&nbsp;bad experiences&nbsp;with vanilla javascript. We found that evolutions on JS like Typescript were also on a&nbsp;shaky foundation. Despite the JS ecosystem being popular and old, it didn’t feel very mature. Finally, we didn’t like the way most js-based applications, whether&nbsp;Electron&nbsp;or React Native&nbsp;felt.\nBoth JS and Scala would require tremendous overhead due to the default environments in which they run. We needed something lighter weight than invoking a little browser every time we wanted to call into our&nbsp;core. Our team members were pretty experienced in Golang, and&nbsp;Cgo&nbsp;was an ideal fit for what we were looking for. It would allow us to ship our&nbsp;core&nbsp;as a C library accessible from any programing language we were interested in inter-operating with. There were some concerns we had about the long-term overhead of&nbsp;cgo&nbsp;and garbage collection generally, but those wouldn’t be immediate concerns.\nSimilarly, Rust had a pretty rich collection of tools for generating C bindings for Rust programs and a pretty mature conceptualization of&nbsp;FFI. Though it wasn’t an immediate criterion we were inspired by the fact that most everything in Rust was a&nbsp;zero-cost abstraction. In that spirit, FFI in Rust would have virtually no additional overhead when compared to a C program. We were also drawn to&nbsp;Cargo&nbsp;which felt like the package manager for a language we were waiting for, particularly useful for our complicated build process.\nOur strongest contenders for languages here were Rust, Go, and C.\nTaking the plunge\nLearning Rust wasn’t a smooth process, but solid documentation helped us overcome the steep learning curve. Every language I’ve learned so far has shaped the way I view programming, it was refreshing to see the interaction of high-level concepts like Iterators, Dynamic Dispatch, and pattern matching discussed alongside their performance implications.\nRust has an interesting approach to memory management: it heavily restricts what you can do with references. In return, it will guarantee all your references are always valid and free of race conditions. It will do this at compile time, without the need for any costly runtime abstraction like Garbage Collection.\nOnce we were over the learning curve we prototyped the&nbsp;core library&nbsp;we’d been planning, a CLI, and a Server that used it. During a period when many of us were rapidly prototyping many different solutions, this was the one that stood the test of time. Soon after the CLI, a C binding followed, then an&nbsp;iOS and macOS application. Today we have a&nbsp;JNI bindings&nbsp;and an&nbsp;Android app&nbsp;as well. This core library will one day be packaged and documented as the&nbsp;Lockbook SDK&nbsp;allowing you to extend Lockbook from any language (more on this later).\nFurther personal reflections\nYou can probably predict what your experience with Rust is going to be based on how you felt about the above two priorities. Rust is an experiment in the highest-level features implemented at no runtime cost. If you feel like the Option&lt;T&gt; is not a useful construct, you’re not likely to appreciate waiting for the compiler. If you don’t mind the latency introduced by garbage collection you’re not going to enjoy wrestling the&nbsp;borrow checker.&nbsp;\nI wasn’t specifically seeking out performance, but before Rust, while programming there was always a slight uncertainty about whether I would have to re-write a given component in C, or spend time tuning a garbage collector. In Rust I don’t write everything optimally initially, when I need to, I’ll clone() things or stick them in an Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt; to revisit at a later time, but I appreciate that all these artifacts of the productivity vs. performance trade-offs are explicitly present for me to review, rather than implicitly constrained by my development environment.\nFor our team, learning Rust has certainly been a dynamic in onboarding new contributors. Certainly, we’ve lost contributors who didn’t buy into the ideas and were turned away because of Rust. But we’ve also encountered people who are specifically seeking out Rust projects because they share our excitement. It’s hard to tell what the net impact here is, but as is the case every year: Rust is a&nbsp;a language a lot of people love. Significant Open Source and Commercial entities from Linux to AWS are making permanent investments in Rust.\nThis excitement does however bring a lot of Junior talent to the ecosystem, subsequently, even though it’s roughly as old as Go, many of Rust’s packages feel like they’re not ready for production. By my estimation, this is because in addition to understanding the subject matter of the package they’re creating a maintainer of a library needs to understand Rust pretty deeply. Additionally, within the Rust ecosystem, some people are optimizing for different things. Some people are optimizing for compile times and binary size, while others are optimizing for static inference and performance, in many cases these are mutually exclusive values.&nbsp;\nIn some cases, this is a short-term problem features are stabilized, and best practices are identified. In other cases, this is an irreconcilable aspect of the ecosystem that will simply result in lots of packages that are solving the same problem in slightly different ways.\nThis is something we should expect, as Rust is a language that’s trying to serve all programmers from UI developers to OS designers. And though it may cost me some productivity in the short term while I’m forced to contend with this nuance, in the long term it massively broadens my horizons as a software engineer.\nPersonally what got me over the steep learning curve is a rare feeling that the knowledge I’m building while learning Rust is a permanent investment in my future, not a trivial detail about a flaw of the tool I’m using. I’m very excited to see where Rust takes us all in the future.\n","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/core/","title":"Why Lockbook chose Rust"},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/creating-a-sick-cli/":{"body":"Creating a SICK CLI\nAt Lockbook we strongly believe in dogfooding. So we knew alongside a great, native, markdown editing experience we would want a sick CLI. Having a sick CLI creates interesting opportunities for a niche type of user who is familiar with a terminal environment:\n\nThey can use the text editor they're deeply familiar with.\nThey can write scripts against their Lockbook.\nThey can vastly reduce the surface area of attack.\nCan always maintain remote access to their Lockbook via SSH.\n\nIn this post I’m going to tackle 3 topics:\n\nWhat makes a CLI sick?\nHow do you go about realizing some of those “interesting opportunities” using our CLI?\nWhat’s next for our CLI?\n\nWhat makes a CLI sick?\nIt’s tab completions. For me, tab completions are what I use to initially explore what a CLI can do. Later, if the CLI is sick, I use tab completions to speed up my workflow. I don’t just want to tab complete the structure of the CLI (subcommands and flags). I want to tab complete dynamic values, in Lockbook's case, this means completing file paths and IDs.\nIf you're creating a CLI most libraries make you choose between a few bad options:\n\nHand-craft completion files for each shell.\nSacrifice dynamic completions and just settle for automatically generated static completions.\n\nRust is no exception here, clap has some support for static completions, but no way to invoke dynamic completions without writing a completion file for each shell.\nAnd so we set out to solve this problem for the Rust ecosystem, and created cli-rs. A parsing library, similar to clap but with explicit design priorities around creating a great tab completion experience. As soon as cli-rs was stable enough we re-wrote lockbook's CLI using it so we could pass on these gains to our users.\nCli-rs is simple, you describe your CLI like this:\n\nThis gives the parser all the information it needs to offer the best tab completion behavior. It handles all the static completions internally and then invokes your program when it’s time to dynamically populate a field with your user’s data.\nWe also invested a ton of effort in the infrastructure that deploys our CLI to our customer's machines so that tab completions would be set up for most people by default.\nExciting Opportunities for Power Users\nUse your favorite text editor\nYou can lockbook edit any path you have access to and our CLI will invoke vim, utilizing any custom .vimrc that may exist. You can override the selected editor by setting the LOCKBOOK_EDITOR env var or using the --editor flag. So far we support vim, nvim, subl, code, emacs and nano.\nIf we don’t support your favorite editor, send us a PR or hop in our discord and tell us.\nExtending Lockbook\nWe want Lockbook to be maximally extensible, this extensibility will take many forms, one of which is our CLI. Let's explore some of the interesting things you can accomplish with our CLI.\nLet’s say you wanted a snapshot of everything in your second brain decrypted and without any proprietary format for tin-foil-hat backup reasons. You can easily set a cron that will simply lockbook sync and lockbook backup however often you want. lockbook export can be used to write any folder or document from Lockbook to your file system, paving the way for automated updates of a blog. Edit a note on your phone, and see the change live on your blog in seconds. lockbook import lets you do the opposite. Want to continuously back up a folder from your computer to Lockbook? Setup a cron that will simply Lockbook import and then lockbook sync.\nUltra secure\nI like to think about security as the product of a few numbers. So if, for example, you’re product is closed source, one of those numbers in your multiplication chain is a big fat zero. And there’s nothing you can do to pretend it’s secure. Similarly, the age of a product is one of those numbers. Newer is worse, and this is one of Lockbook’s current weaknesses.\nBut one of Lockbook’s strengths is how much you can reduce the total amount of code it takes to interact with Lockbook. On one end of the spectrum, you have software that requires a full browser installation to perform the most basic tasks. Slightly better than that is software that runs natively, and on the other end of the spectrum is software that doesn’t even rely on a UI library. Once we’re mature, if you wanted to run Lockbook on a libre-booted thinkpad running an ultra-minimal operating system, Lockbook wouldn’t require you to add the Google Chrome dependency tree to your setup.\nRemote Lockbook\nSometimes you find yourself employed by a financial institution that heavily restricts what you can do on their machines. Without thinking too much more about your situation you may want to simply add something to your grocery list without pulling out your phone. Unfortunately, IT has locked down your remote Windows 7 installation, and not only can you not install our Windows app (which does not require administrator privileges to install) but you cannot visit GitHub itself!\nMaybe in this environment, it’s not worth it to update your grocery list, but you identify with the likes of Ron Swanson, and you will not be defeated by your IT department. How? Because you port forwarded your desktop and memorized a lengthy SSH password. So you ssh in, use your favorite text editor, and you update that grocery list. There’s no stopping you.\nWhat’s next for our CLI\nOur CLI has come a long way, we've experimented with various ways of allowing you to quickly find a note and edit it. In the past we experimented with piping output to programs like fzf, we even tried implementing a custom full-screen search. This is the approach that feels the best to us and we think is going to stand the test of time. But work is never done, so here are some of the things we plan to tackle in our CLI:\n\nContinue to invest in our release infrastructure to bring our CLI to more package managers. If you'd like to become a maintainer for a particular distro reach out!.\nSupport richer parser inputs including variable number of arguments, grouped command line flags, and logical de-duplication of tab completions (this flag or argument is already specified so don't suggest it again).\nDeeper integrations with shells in cli-rs: offer ways to express that this argument is a normal file with completions, or implement mechanisms to re-write the current prompt (lockbook edit sick&lt;tab&gt; tab completes: lockbook edit writing/parth.cafe/creating-a-sick-cli.md presently tab completion options must begin with the current prompt).\nA richer showcase of interesting things we can do with our CLI, we plan to set up our blog the way I described above and provide concrete examples of how to do many of the things I outlined. So if you haven't already subscribe to the Lockbook Blog, and Lockbook Youtube Channel.\n\n","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/creating-a-sick-cli/","title":"Creating a SICK CLI"},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/db-rs/":{"body":"db-rs\nThe story of how Lockbook created its own database for speed and productivity.\nAs a backend engineer, the architecture I see used most commonly is a loadbalancer distributing requests to several horizontally scaled API servers. Those API servers are generally talking to one or more stores of state. Lockbook also started this way, we load balanced requests using HAProxy, had a handful of Rust API nodes, and stored our data in Postgres and S3.\nA year into the project, we had developed enough of the product that we understood our needs more clearly, but we were still early enough into our journey where we could make breaking changes and run experiments. I had some reservations about this default architecture, and before the team stabilized our API, I wanted to see if we could do better.\nMy first complaint was about our interactions with SQL. It was annoying to shuffle data back and forth from the fields of our structs into columns of our tables. Over time our SQL queries grew more complicated, and it was hard to express and maintain ideas like a user's file tree cannot have cycles or a file cannot have the same name as a non-deleted sibling. We were constantly trying to determine whether we should express something in SQL, or read a user's data into our API server, perform and validate the operation in Rust, and then save the new state of their file tree. Concerns around transaction isolation, consistency, and performance were always hard to reason about. We were growing frusterated because we knew how we want this data to be stored and processed and were burning cycles fighting our declarative environment.\nMy second complaint was about how much infrastructure we had to manage. While on the topic of Postgres itself, running Postgres at a production scale is not trivial. There's a great deal of trivia you have to understand to make Postgres work properly with your API servers and your hardware. First we had to understand what features of Postgres our database libraries supported. In our case, that meant evaluating whether we needed to additionally run PGBouncer, Postgres' connection pooling server, and potentially another piece of infrastructure to manage. Regardless of PGBouncer, configuring Postgres itself requires an understanding of how Postgres interacts with your hardware. From Postgres' configuration guide:\n\nPostgreSQL ships with a basic configuration tuned for wide compatibility rather than performance. Odds are good the default parameters are very undersized for your system....\n\nThat's just Postgres. Similar complexities existed for S3, HAProxy, and the networking and monitoring considerations of all the nodes mentioned thus far. This was quickly becoming overwhelming, and we hadn't broken ground on user collaboration, one of our most ambitious features. For a team sufficiently large this may be no big deal. Just hire some ops people to stand up the servers so the software engineers can engineer the software. For our resource-constrained team of 5, this wasn't going to work. Additionally, when we surveyed the useful work our servers were performing, we knew this level of complexity was unnecessary.\nFor example, when a user signs up for Lockbook or makes an edit to a file, the actual useful work that our server did to record that information should have taken no more than 2ms. But from our load balancer's reporting, those requests were taking 50-200ms. We were using all these heavy-weight tools to be able to field lots of concurrent requests without paying any attention to how long those requests were taking. Would we need all this if the requests were fast?\nWe ran some experiments with Redis and stored files in EBS instead of S3, and the initial results were promising. We expressed all our logic in Rust and vastly increased the amount of code we were able to share with our clients (core). We dramatically reduced our latency, and our app felt noticeably faster. However, most of that request time was spent waiting for Redis to respond over the network (even if we hosted our application and database on the same server). And we were still spending time ferrying information in and out of Redis. I knew something was interesting to explore here.\nSo after a week of prototyping, I created db-rs. The idea was to make a stupid-simple database that could be embedded as a Rust library directly into our application. No network hops, no context switches, and huge performance gains. Have it be easy for someone to specify a schema in Rust, and allow them to pick what the performance characteristics of these simple key-value style tables would be. This is Core's schema, for instance:\n\nThe types Single, LookupTable, and List are db-rs table types. They are backed by Rust Option, HashMap, or Vec respectively. They capture changes to their data structures, Serialize those changes and append them to the end of a log -- one of the fastest ways to persist an event.\nThe types Account, SignedFile, Uuid, etc are types Lookbook is using. They all implement the ubiquitous Serialize Deserialize traits, so we never again need to think about converting between our types and their on-disk format. Internally db-rs uses  bincode format, an incredibly performant and compact representation of your data.\nWhat's cool here is that when you query out of a table, you're handed pointers to your data. The database isn't fetching bytes, serializing them, or sending them over the wire for your program to then shuffle into its fields. A read from one of these tables is a direct memory access, and because of Rust's memory guarantees, you can be sure that reference will be valid for the duration of your access to it.\nWhat's exciting from an ergonomics standpoint is that your schema is statically known by your editor. It's not defined and running on a server somewhere else. So if you type db. you get a list of your tables. If you select one, then that table-type's contract is shown to you, with your keys and values. Additionally for us, now our backend stack doesn't require any container orchestration whatsoever: you just need cargo to run our server. This has been massive boon for quickly setting up environments whether locally or in production.\nThe core ideas of the database are less than 800 lines of code and are fairly easy to reason about. This is a database that's working well for us not because of what it does, but because of all the things it doesn't do. And what we've gained from db-rs is a tremendous amount of performance and productivity.\nUltimately this is a different way to think about scaling a backend. When you string together 2-4 pieces of infrastructure over the network, you're incurring a big latency cost, and hopefully what you're gaining as a result is availability. But are you? If you're using something like Postgres, you're also in a situation where your database is your single point of failure. You've just surrounded that database with a lot of ceremonies, and I'm skeptical that the ceremony helps Postgres respond to queries faster or that it helps engineers deliver value more quickly.\ndb-rs has been running in production for half a year at this point. Most requests are replied to in less than 1 ms. we anticipate that on a modest EC2 node, we should be able to scale to hundreds of thousands of users and field hundreds of requests per second. Should we need to, we can  scale vertically 1-2 orders of magnitude beyond this point. Ultimately our backend plans to follow a scaling strategy similar to email where users have a home server. And our long-term vision is one of a network of decentralized server operators. But that's a dream that's still quite far away.\nAs a result, what Lockbook ultimately converged on, is probably my new default approach for building simple backend systems. If this intrigues you, check out the source code of db-rs or take it for a spin.\nCurrently db-rs exactly models the needs of Lockbook. there are key weaknesses around areas of concurrency and offloading seldom accessed data to disk. Whenever Lockbook or one of db-rs' users needs these things, they'll be added. Feel free to open an issue or pull request!\ndb-rs (attempt 2)\nWhen Lockbook first began, it's architecture was I would consider the typical backend architecture. When a client would make a request, it would be load balanced to one of several api servers. The selected api server would communicate either Postgres, and S3 to fulfill that request. As we designed the product we understood our needs better and gradually re-evaluated various components of our architecture. We learned a lot through this process and although our needs are not unique, the architecture we're converging towards is unique in it's simplicity: a single api server, running a single Rust program. In part this architecture was enabled by an expressive, lightweight, embedded database I wrote called db-rs. Transitioning to this architecture allowed us to move much more quickly and we expect it to (conservatively) handle hundreds of requests a second made by hundreds of thousands of users all for around $50 / month. Today, for most typical projects, this would be my default approach.\nLike most backends, we have users who have accounts, accounts manage our domain specific objects: their File. Both users and files have metadata associated with them, users have billing information, files have names, locations, collaboration information, size, etc.\nWe were finding that doing typical things in the context of a typical architecture was slow and annoying. For instance much of this data modeling and access would be done with SQL. Your backend however is certainly not written in SQL, so this requires some level of data conversion for every field that your server persists. There's likely to be subtle mismatches around how your langauge handles types (limits, signs, encoding) or even meta ideas around types (nullability). You may try an ORM which has it's own strengths and weaknesses. We also found that modeling certain ideas about files was hard to do at the database level: for instance, two files with the same parent cannot have the same name, unless one of them is deleted. Or even trickier: you cannot have a cycle in your file tree.\nMaybe it's silly to try to do this in SQL, so instead you read all the relevant data into your application and run your validations in your server and only write to the database once you're satisfied with the state of your data. But make you're up-to speed on your transaction isolation types! Oh also make sure no one writes to your database without going through your server first otherwise they may invalidate your assumptions.\nOkay maybe you do want to do this in SQL then, so you write a complicated query in a language with very little support for things like tests or package manager. And hope that you've expressed your query and setup your tables in a manner that performs acceptably. Okay let's say you've crossed all those hurdles, let's setup some environments: you can have your team install postgres directly and field complaints about it being a pretty heavy application or you can containerize it and field complaints about docker instead. In production you have to determine whether you need pg_bouncer for connection pooling. Okay what about configuring Postgres itself for production, can I just run Postgres on a Linux instance? Nope (from postgres.org):\n\nPostgreSQL ships with a basic configuration tuned for wide compatibility rather than performance. Odds are good the default parameters are very undersized for your system.\n\nNot too bad once you read through, but after some reflection this was the sort of thing slowing our team down. We had similar interactions with our load balancer and S3. In the past we've had similar intereactions with tools we've seen our day-jobs use at scale. We were ready to try something new to see if we'd have different outcomes. Our application code itself, while complicated, was a tiny fraction of the total request time. We re-architected to eliminate all network traffic from our server, instead of Postgres initially we used a mutex, a bunch of hash tables, and an append only log. Instead of S3 we saved files locally using EBS. We configured our warp rust server to directly handle tls connections rather than our load balancer. Our latencies across all our endpoints were down to less than 2ms without any attention paid to performance within our application layer. We realized we didn't need concurrency, or horizontal scalability just for it's own sake. We wanted our application to be able to scale to the userbase of our dreams, and bringing the latency of each endpoint down by several orders of magnitude was a far easier way to achieve that goal.\nInspired by the initial results I sat down to see how much progress I could do on the core idea. db-rs is what resulted. In db-rs you specify your database schema in Rust:\n\nA single source of truth, version controlled alongside all your other application logic. The types you see are your Rust types, as long as your type implements the ubiquitous Serialize Deserialize traits you won't have to write any conversion code to persist your information. You can select a table type with known and straightforward performance characteristics. Everything within the database is statically known. So all your normal rust-related tooling can easily answer questions like \"what tables do I have\", how do I append to this table? What key does this query expect? What value will it give me?\nMoreover, when you query, you're handed references to data from within the database, resulting in the fastest possible reads. When you write, your data is serialized in the bincode format, an incredibly performant and compact representation of your data, persisted to an append-only-log, one of the fastest ways to persist a piece of information generally.\nAs a result of this new way of thinking about our backend, we don't have to learn the nitty gritty off:\n\nSQL\nPostgres at scale\nS3\nLoad balancers\n\nLocally using this database is just a matter of cargo run'ing your server, which is a massive boon for iteration speed and project onboarding. People trying to self host lockbook (not a use case fully supported just yet, but a priority for us) are going to have a significantly easier time doing so now.\nIf you're primarily storing things that could be stored within Postgres, and are writing a Rust application, the productivity and performance gains are likely going to be very similar for you. If you had a reference to all your data and could easily generate a response to a given API request within 1ms you're likely also looking at a throughput of hundreds of requests per second. If you're an experienced Rust developer think about how quickly you could get a twitter clone off the ground.\nIf this intrigues you, checkout the source code of db-rs or take it for a spin. The source code is less than 800 significant lines of code, and currently reflects the exact needs of Lockbook. It's very possible that it falls short for you in some way, for instance currently your entire dataset must fit in memory (like Redis), this is fine for Lockbook for the next year or so, but will one day no longer be okay. If this is a problem for you, feel free to open an issue or pull request!\nLockbook's architectural history (attempt 1)\nToday Lockbook's architecture is relatively simple: we have a core library which is used by all clients to connect to a server. Both core and server are responsible for managing the metadata associated each file and it's content. Our server is a single mid-sized ec2 instance, and makes no network connections for file-related operations. Our core library communicates directly with our server. Operations that may be traditionally handled by a reverse proxy (ssl connection negotiation, load balancing, etc) are handled by a single rust binary. Our stack achieves throughput and scale by being minimal and fast: our server responds to all file related requests with sub-millisecond latency.\nOur stack wasn't always this lean, when we first set out our stack looked much more traditional: we used haproxy to load balance requests and provide tls between 2 server nodes. Our server stored files in s3 and metadata in postgres. In core we stored our metadata in sqlite.  For most teams, out growing a simple tool usually takes the form of adopting a more complicated-full-featured version of that tool. For us, outgrowing a tool often involved taking a step back and creating a simpler version of the tool that fit our needs better.\nFile contents\nTake s3 for instance. We found that interacting with s3 was becoming too slow, and a source of, albiet rarely, outages. We saw 3 paths forward:\n\nInvest deeper in s3. We could expose our users (encrypted) publicly, and have core directly fetch files from s3 instead of having our server abstract this away.\nMake our architecture more complicated by caching s3 files somewhere.\nHave our server manage the files itself, locally.\n\nWith s3 we had a handful of crates that we could choose between. If we managed files ourselves (writing locally to a drive), we'd be programming against a significantly more stable and well understood api: Posix System Calls. We could use ebs to make various tradeoffs for performance and cost. We would have a slight increase in code complexity as we'd need to learn how to do atomic writes (write the file somewhere temporarily, and atomically rename it when the write is complete). But we'd have a significant decrease in overall engineering complexity:\n\nno need to learn about s3 specific concepts (access control, presigned urls, etc).\nno need to simulate s3 in environments where using s3 is infeasible (local development, CI, on-prem deployments). No need to wonder if there's subtle differences between various s3 compliant products.\nsignificantly smaller surface area of failure.\n\nFile metadata\nInitially file metadata was stored in Postgres, and to better understand why we moved away from Postgres, I should explain what our metadata storage goals are. When a user attempts to modify a file in some way we need to enforce a number of constraints. We need to make sure no one modifies someone else's files, no one updates a deleted file, no one puts a tree in an invalid state (cycles, path conflicts, etc), and so on. Initially we tried to express these operations and constraints in SQL and after a couple rounds of iteration it was clear this wasn't the right approach. Our SQL expressions were complicated, hard to maintain, and the source of many subtle bugs.\nSo we took a step back and moved significant amounts of our logic into rust. The flow of a request was now, a user is trying to perform operation X, fetch all relevant context from the database, perform the operation, run validations, persist the side-effects. This moved most of the complexity back into rust where we could easily write tests, use 3rd party libraries, and iterate quickly with a compiler.\nEven with this refactor, we were still largely unsure about our usage of Postgres. Managing Postgres at scale is non-trivial, the surface area of learning how to configure postgres to keep more data in memory and juggle multiple parallel connections (pg-bouncer) is pretty large. Additionally the local development experience of Postgres was pretty poor, it either involved a deep install on your system, or nescesitated containers. And ultimately there were subtle differences between how it may be configured locally and in production, differences which could meaningfully impact the way queries executed. Finally we were willing to do more up-front thinking about how we would store and access data. We didn't need the flexibility of SQL, and found ourselves facing more problems due to the declarative nature of SQL.\nSince most of the complicated parts were in Rust, switching to Redis was a fairly inexpensive engineering lift. It was significantly easier to reason about how Redis would behave in various situations and manage it at scale under load. Redis was dropped in as a replacement to Postgres, and with this replacement we were able to eliminate an organization wide dependency on docker. Another set of associated concepts we'd no longer need to reason about to achieve our goals. Our team experienced a vastly better local development experience from this change.\nIt was now time to pay attention to core. Core shares similar goals to our server with regards to the operations it's trying to perform, but it is additionally constrained by requiring an embedded database and is sensitive to things like startup time and resource requirements. Core also needs to be easy to build for any arbitary rust target, the ideal database would probably be a pure Rust project. Our journey started with SQLite and was a bumpy one initially for some of our compilation targets. But the journey ended the moment we were no longer interested in expressing complicated operations in SQL. Informed by our server-side experience, we left the problem intentionally unsolved for a while as we invested in other areas of the project. We simply persisted our data in a giant JSON files. As we expected while we were in the early days we experienced issues of data corruption as sometimes our writes would be interrupted or multiple processes sharing a data directory would cause data-race-conditions.\ndb-rs\nAfter investing in other areas of our project I had done a lot of thinking around databases, especially around what would be ideal for a project that wanted to express as much in Rust as possible. I wanted a database that was fast by virtue of minimalism. For instance, simply being embedded affords your application a massive amount of throughput. For our project, this also meant that we could just stick our database behind a Mutex and significantly reduce the number of problems we're trying to solve at the moment. I wanted a database that was designed with rust users in mind and ultra-low-latency. I also wanted to provide rust users with an ergonomic way for users to express a schema, with rust types (not database specific types) and not have them worry about serialization formats.\nWe needed a database that was:\n\nembedded\nfast\nergonomic\ndurable\n\nSo in about a week I created db-rs.\nOnce db-rs existed, with the abstractions present in core and server, it was easy to drop it in. Once again, this simplification boosted performance massively, simplified our code, and simplified our infrastructure, and reduced the number of foreign concepts that our team needed to understand and fbuild around.\nWith the request latency the lowest we'd ever seen it, without any significant effort to optimize our code (just eliminate things we didn't want), we also eliminated nginx and just had warp perform tls handshakes and commit to a single server node for the near future. We estimate this modestly priced ec2 instance ($50 / month) can handle hundreds of requests a second from hundreds of thousands of users. If we need to, we have a healthy amount of vertical scaling headroom. Beyond that, our long term plan involves a scaling strategy similar to what's used by self-hosted email.\nToday our only remaining project dependency for most work is just the rust toolchain. Local dev environments spin up instantly without the need for any container or network configuration. Deploying a server means building a binary for linux and executing it.\n","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/db-rs/","title":"db-rs"},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/editor/":{"body":"Lockbook's Editor\nBuilding a complex UI element in Rust that can be embedded in any UI framework\nAs Lockbook's infrastructure stabilized, we began to focus on our markdown editing experience. Across our various platforms, we've experimented with a few approaches for providing our users with an ergonomic way to edit their files. On Android, we use Markwon, a community-built markdown editor. On Apple, we initially did the same thing but found that the community components didn't have many of the features our users were asking for. So as a next step, we dove into Apple's TextKit API to begin work on a more ambitious editor.\nInitially, this was fine, but as we worked through our backlog of requests, I found things that were going to be very time-expensive to implement using this API. We were having performance problems when editing large documents. The API was difficult to work with, especially because there were no open existing bodies of work that implemented features like automatic insertion of text (when adding to a list), support for non-text-characters (bullets, checkboxes, inline images), or multiple cursors (real-time collaboration or power user text editing). Even if we did invest the effort to pioneer these features using TextKit, we would have to replicate our efforts on our other platforms. And lastly, none of my other teammates knew the TextKit API intimately, so I wouldn't be able to easily call on their help for one of the most important aspects of our product. We needed a different approach.\nIn the past, I've discussed our core library -- a place we've been able to solve some of our hardest \"backend\" problems and bring them to foreign programming environments. We needed something like this for a UI component we needed a place where we could invest the time, build an editor from the ground up, and embed it in any UI library.\nWe considered creating a web component. Perhaps we could mitigate some of the downsides of web apps if we were only presenting a web-based view when a document was loaded. Maybe we could leverage Rust's great support for web assembly for the complicated internals. Ultimately I felt like we could do better, so I continued thinking about the problem. On Linux, we'd begun experimenting with egui: a lightweight, Rust, UI library. Their README had a long list of places you could embed egui, and I wondered if I could add SwiftUI or Android to that list.\nAnd so began my journey of gaining a deeper understanding of wgpu, immediate mode UIs, and how this editor might work on mobile devices.\nMost UI frameworks have an API for directly interfacing with a lower-level graphics API. In SwiftUI, for instance, you can create an MTKView which gives you access to MetalKit (Apple's hardware accelerated graphics API). Using this view, you can effectively pass a reference to the GPU into Rust code and initialize an egui component. In the host UI framework you can capture whichever events you need (keyboard &amp; mouse events for instance) and pass them to the embedded UI framework. It's the simplicity of immediate mode programming which enables this to be achievable in a short period, and it's the flexibility of immediate mode programming which makes it a great choice for complex and ambitious UI components. The approach seemed like it held promise so we gave it a go.\nAfter a month of prototyping and pair programming with my co-founder Travis, we had done it. We shipped a version of our Text Editor on macOS, Windows, and Linux which supported many of the features our team and users had been craving. The editor was incredibly high-performance, easily achieving 120fps on massive documents. Most importantly we have a clear picture of how we would go about implementing our most ambitious features over the next couple of years.\nAfter we released the editor on the desktop, we began the process of bringing it to mobile devices. This was a new frontier for this approach. On macOS, we just had to pass through keyboard and mouse events. On a mobile device, there are many subtle ways people can edit documents. There are auto-correct, speech-to-text, and clever ways to navigate documents. After some research, we found a neatly documented protocol -- UITextInput -- which outlines the various ways in which you can interact with a software keyboard on iOS. We also found a corresponding document in Android's documentation.\nSo back to work we went. We expanded on our SwiftUI &lt;--&gt; egui integration giving it the ability to handle events that egui doesn't recognize. We piped through these new events, refined the way we handle mouse/touch inputs, and a couple of weeks ago, we merged our iOS editor bringing many of our gains to a new form factor.\nWe're very excited about the possibilities this technique opens up for us. It allows us to maintain the look &amp; feel that users crave while giving us an escape hatch down into our preferred programming environment when we need it. Once our editor is more mature and the kinks of our integration are worked out, we plan to apply this strategy to more document types. Long term we're interested in making it easy for people to quickly spin up their own SwiftUI component backed by Rust (as presently this still requires a lot of boilerplate code).\nOn net, the editor has been a big step forward for us. It's already live on desktops and will be shipping on iOS as part of our upcoming 0.7.5 release. It's a large and fresh body of work, so we anticipate some bugs. If you encounter any, please report them to our Github issues. And, as always, if you'd like to join our community, we'd love to have you on our Discord server.\n","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/editor/","title":"Lockbook's Editor"},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/future-race-car/":{"body":"future race car\nI’ve enjoyed a number of exciting vehicles so far. I’ve owned some motorcycles, off-road vehicles, and performance-oriented cars. I’ve modified most of these and I’ve been to the track a handful of times. Both of these things made me curious about building a dedicated track car. I’ve particularly been drawn to cars with such a rich aftermarket that they’re called platforms.\nSo in my exploration, I considered a number of platforms, I have a bunch of experience with Audi, but I wanted a more traditional rear-wheel drive, manual sports car. Audi’s are generally AWD cars, and manual variants are rarer due to a pretty good dual-clutch transmission. BMW seemed like a good iteration, I could get something newer and treat it as a normal second car for a few years and then turn it into a track car later. Or I could get something older and begin building immediately. I ended up shying away from this option for a few reasons.\n\nLuxury German cars start their lives as a racecar much heavier. This means you’re going to run through consumables like brakes, and tires much more quickly. And you have to make more power to be competitive.\nYou’re paying a tax for the brand name at every interaction. Performance upgrades cost more when you want to go faster, and replacement parts cost more when you go too fast and break things.\nYou’re more often fighting the manufacturer who wants you to bring the car into a dealership. When you’re changing rear brakes on vehicles that have electronic parking brakes you sometimes have to put the car into a service mode. On a Ford vehicle, this involves pressing and holding a couple of buttons while you start the car. On Audis this procedure can only be done either through a dealer or by using a grassroots OBD2 bluetooth device and app which costs a micro-transaction for a variety of such services. There are also generally more luxuries in your way which the removal of may not be handled particularly gracefully by the car (racing seats and steering wheel come to mind).\n\nAfter mulling this over I knew I was either choosing an American pony car (Mustang / Camaro / Corvette) or a Japanese Tuner (Miata, Z, BRZ, Supra). This was a tough choice as I’m a die-hard American, and I presently have an F-150 and surely some of that mechanical familiarity would transfer over to a Mustang. Chevy LS swaps are also pretty sick. But ultimately I opted for the foreign import for the lower cost of entry. I was particularly blown away by what I saw surrounding the Mazda Miata.\n\nDepending on your criteria you can probably get into a Miata for as low as $4k. To most Miata grey beards this is an all-time high price, it’s not uncommon to hear about someone getting a basic Miata for $1k a couple of years ago. This leaves plenty in the build department. This also leaves plenty in the replace-the-car-if-I-destroy-it department.\nAnd boy can you build. Anything you saw them do in a Fast and Furious movie you can do to a Miata. Almost every part is widely available and inexpensive from a restoration perspective. There are a number of companies dedicated to providing specifically the Miata with aftermarket parts like Flyin’ Miata. There’s a rich knowledge base in forums and on YouTube. Donut Media (one of the largest car YouTube channels) did a series of videos building a track Miata. There are a number of performance strategies being explored including:\n\nTurbocharging\nSupercharged Miatas\nSwapping engines to the reliable and more powerful Honda K-Series motor\nSwapping engines to the monstrously powerful LS V8\nOr dropping ~35% of the weight of the Miata to create the Exocet\n\n\nThe Miata is a “generation” based car, like the Jeep. In its lifespan since 1990 there have been 4 generations of Miata: NA (‘90-’97), NB (‘98-’05), NC (‘05-’15), ND (‘15-). They all have a very similar personality:\n\n\n\nVery light\n\n\nGreat handling\nNot that powerful\n\nThe price gets rather high in the NC &amp; ND range and I’m not sure it’s as compelling a purchase. The NA and NB Miatas however, are maybe the best value in the niche I’ve described so far. A great value means more room in the budget for building (and replacing the car if I go into a wall at 110mph).\nThere is however a key distinction between the NA and NB.\nThe NA Miata has pop-up headlights which make the car cute and charming.\n\nThe NB Does not.\n\n\nSo NA Miata it was, and NA’s are a little rare in my area. But even within the NA Miata there’s a faction. During ‘90-’93 the Miata used a 1.6L engine, ‘93 onwards they used a 1.8L engine in the US (~10% more powerful). I found that this engine has a ~$1k premium. The second performance bit I was looking for was a Torsen Limited Slip Differential. A differential helps your drive wheels rotate at different speeds in turns. In traction-limited settings (off-road or while shredding tires) a normal differential will allow the power to get sucked into the wheel that loses traction, which guarantees that wheel will not regain traction. An LSD helps deliver power to both wheels regardless of traction levels. In my search, an LSD inflated the price of the car another $1k.\n\nAnd so, for $8750 I picked up a British Racing Green, M-Edition Miata from ‘97 with ~113k miles. The color is rare and is also my wife’s favorite color. Doing a test drive, finding no rust, and seeing above-average service history sealed the deal for me.\n\nWorry not, I’ll update this picture with one that doesn’t include a dumpster full of construction debris when I get a chance.\nI’m excited to use this blog to share the journey this Miata will take as it is restored, modernized, and upgraded for the race track.\n","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/future-race-car/","title":"Building a race car."},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/ideation/":{"body":"Over the last 10 years I've gone through the process of ideation, execution and delivery countless times. I'd like to share some lessons I've learned and how I think about projects today.\nThe Idea\nIt's hard to evaluate how important an idea is relative to execution and presentation.\nI think ideas are a dime a dozen, and most projects fail not because the idea was bad, but because an attempt was never made.\nHowever, you should expect good ideas to be rare. I like using challenge oriented thinking to filter out bad ideas:\nFirst filter: does this exist already? It may exist, and be popular, and maybe you just give that product or service a try. Maybe it doesn't exist because it's a foolish idea that would never work. Or maybe it doesn't exist because no one's made it yet. If you don't make stuff, there is no stuff. Perhaps bringing this thing into existence is your calling.\nMaybe your idea is out there already, you give it a try and have a bad experience. When you're ready to give up on this product, you wonder to yourself: \"Can I do a better job?\". You have to evaluate how much your execution edge is. Do you have the expertise and resources to do this better? Have you overlooked something that makes this very hard? Peter Thiel's Zero to One explores this idea in a bit more depth. In short he provides the following intuition: unless your execution is orders of magnitude better than your competition you're better of seeking novel ideas that have a higher likelihood of earning you a monopoly.\nOnce this \"market research\" filter has been overcome, I look to gain perspective from people I respect. Traits I look for in people to discuss ideas with: generally capable people, well-read, and open minded. I want objective feedback, but I'm not too interested in knee-jerk reactions. My favorite conversations are ones where we try to build up the idea then see if we can tear it apart.\nAfter this, I just let the idea sit in a document next to other ideas. Unless there's a unique opportunity, I'm primarily interested in working on things that would help me in some way. Once it lives in my notebook alongside other ideas, whenever I next feel the need for this I'll make a note. As I'm going through life, I'll put all associated thoughts into this document. My time is limited and this gives me an organic way for my idea to mature and allows me to filter out ideas that seemed interesting in the moment but wouldn't really provide me or anyone any real value.\nBy the time I sit down to start executing on an idea, I'm usually fed up with whatever the stop gap I've been using is, and I'm in a mental state where I don't really care if other people will use this thing I want it to exist for me. In my experience this makes the process of willing the idea into existence a transcendent experience. You'll understand your needs best and stop over-prioritizing the opinion of other people. The basis for a good MVP is the product you would use, not the hackathon power point presentation you're trying to pass off as your product.\nOnce you have a core product you're proud of then you can consider if you want to solicit Lean Startup style feedback from the market and your customers or if you want to continue to take a Job's style visionary approach to your product.\n","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/ideation/","title":"Ideation"},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/imports/":{"body":"","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/imports/","title":""},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/introducing-lockbook/":{"body":"A new note-taking app\nMany moons ago my friends and I found ourselves frustrated with our computing experience. Our most important tools: our messengers, our note-taking apps, and our file storage all seemed to leave us with the same bitter taste in our mouths. Most of the mainstream solutions were trapped inside a browser, the epitome of sacrificing quality for the lowest common denominator. They didn't pass muster for basic security and privacy concerns. Building on top of these systems was a painful experience. We were also growing concerned that we did not share the same ethics and values as the large companies running these platforms.\nSo we ventured out into the land of FOSS. We built our systems from the ground up and experimented with self-hosted solutions. While we learned a lot from this experience, these solutions didn't stand the test of time. As we brought our friends into this world, we found ourselves constantly apologizing for the sub-par experience. It felt like we solved some of our problems, but made other ones (UX) worse.\nAt this point, we took a step back. I knew we could do better. The apps we were being critical of weren't some of the fresher ideas in computing. They are things that we've been doing for decades. Why don't these products feel more mature? What should software that's been around this long feel like?\nWhat is ideal?\nSoftware that's been around this long shouldn't be trapped in the browser. A browser is a convenient place for the discovery of new information, it's not the place I want to visit for heavily used, critical, applications. When I look at my devices, whether on my iPhone or my Linux laptop, the apps I can use with the least friction are simple, native applications. They have the largest context about the device I'm using encoded into the application. This friction-free experience is why people reach for Apple Notes on their iPhones. And when they open those same notes on their iPad they find rich support for their Apple Pencil. For me, a minimal, friction-free context-aware experience is more valuable than feature richness.\nWhatever experience I have on one device should carry over seamlessly to any device I may end up owning in the future. My notes shouldn't be trapped on Apple Devices should I want to transition to Linux. Very few actions should require a network connection, and any network interactions should be deferrable so people outside of metropolitan areas don't have a poor experience.\nFor now, likely most of these services will have to interact with some sort of backend. Everything that backend receives should be encrypted by the customer themselves, in a manner that nobody besides them and the people they give access to can see that content. We shouldn't ask the customer for any information the service doesn't require. There is very little reason that a user  must  provide an email address or a  phone number  to use a note-taking app. This level of security and privacy shouldn't  cost  the user anything in terms of quality. Our customers may be whistle-blowers, journalists, or citizens living under oppressive regimes. They simply cannot afford to trust and they shouldn't have to.\nThis software is too important to not open source. Any software claiming to be secure needs to be open source to prove that claim. Sensitive customers need the ability to build minimal clients with small dependency trees from sources on secure systems. Open-sourcing components like your server signal to the world that they can host critical infrastructure themselves, even if the people behind the product lose the will to keep the lights on. Open source doesn't end in making the source code available, this software should be built out in the open with help from an enthusiastic community. People should be able to extend the tools for fun or profit with minimal friction.\nReaching for an ideal\nAfter much discussion, we decided that the best place to start was a note-taking app. We felt it was the product category with the largest room for growth. Architecturally it also paves the way for us to tackle storing files.

At the moment, Lockbook is not quite ready for adoption as it's in the early stages of alpha testing.

So the car has 113,000 miles at the moment. In the manual, the largest maintainence interval is 60k miles, which means anything that I'm not absolutely sure was done, needs to be done now. So what do we know about this car so far?\n\nI mentioned I was pleased with the vehicle history report. To summarize, it said:\n\nThe car has had about 4 prior owners\nIt's been owned by people who serviced it at dealerships throughout its life. This means it's bone stock, and pretty well maintained. I'm surprised about the couple of items I don't see on this list, but we'll get into that later.\nApart from the oil changes and various checking of parts, the carfax report shows the following items have been replaced:\n\nwater pump\nradiator hoses\ncamshaft position sensor\ndistributor seal\nclutch slave cylinder\nradiator clamps\nthermostat, housing, and gasket\n\n\n\nNothing alarming there. Among other things, absent from this history report are transmission and differential fluid change. That's pretty easy on these cars, there's a fill bolt and a drain bolt. The fill bolt is at a location that constrains the maximum amount of fluid, so you drain the old fluid and pump in the new fluid until you see it overflow.\n\n\n\nAlso absent from the history is any record of spark plugs being replaced. Easy enough:\n\nThese were way past due, you shouldn't be able to tell the gap difference with the naked eye. Also replaced the plug wires while I was at it, kinda cool to see a company make the same product for over 30 years.\n\nWhile I had the car jacked up, I saw that one of my fender liners was held up by thoughts and prayers:\n\nRemoving the fender liner revealed the fasteners underneath, this car was repainted at some point, possibly the shop that did it kept these down here to not lose track of where they came from. Good effort. Now only a handful are missing and are on the way from Amazon.\n\nIt took me a while to track down an annoying squeak: turns out it was coming from the hood latch.\n\nI tried greasing it which helped for a small amount of time. There is some play in the mechanism you use to unlatch the hood but I don't immediately see how I could adjust it without adding washers. Perhaps the problem is how much the chassis flexes in general. I plan to stiffen the car a few different ways, including shock tower bracing that looks something like this.\n\nThis sort of bracing is OEM in some Miatas, but not this one. For now, I'm just going to make my hood latch not be metal by wrapping it in some electrical duct tape. It's not great, but I have bigger fish to fry.\n\nSpeaking of annoying noises, there was a rusty metal rattling coming from the exhaust, and I didn't need too much of an excuse to replace the exhaust of a vehicle. I opted for a higher-end Borla cat-back exhaust.\n\nI struggled tremendously to get the original oxygen sensor out. I used 3/4 of the techniques in my arsenal. I started by hitting it with some penetrating fluid. Upgrading to a \"cheater bar\". I even tried dremelling out the old threads to create a slight relief channel. I stopped short of using MAP gas to heat the threads because I couldn't find my blow torch. Ultimately I just the wire on the old oxygen sensor and grabbed a fresh one from Autozone. So far the exhaust sounds great, it's a bit understated but I'll probably need to wait a couple hundred miles before I know what the real tone will be.\nAnd that's some of the low-hanging fruit on the exterior of the car.

To our surprise, this grew to become one of the largest areas of complexity. Forming consensus is an active area of research in computer science, but Lockbook has an additional constraint. Unlike our competition, large areas of complexity take place on [our user’s devices] that can't update remotely. Additionally, the administrative action we can take is limited: most data entered by users is encrypted, and their devices will reject changes that aren’t signed by people they trust. All this is to say that the cost of error is higher for our team and it’ll likely take longer for our software to mature and reach stability. Today I’d like to share a tester we created to help us find defects and accelerate the maturation process. We affectionately called this tester “the fuzzer”. We’ll explore whether this is a good name a bit later, but first, let’s talk about the sorts of problems we’re trying to detect.\nUsers should be able to do mostly anything offline, so what happens if, say Alice moves a document and Bob renames that document while they were both offline? What happens if they both move a folder? Both edit the same document? What if that document isn’t plain text? What if Alice moves folder A into B, and Bob moves folder B into A?\nSome of these things can be resolved seamlessly while others may require user intervention. Some of the resolution strategies are complicated and error-prone. The fuzzer ensures regardless of what steps a user (or their device) takes various components of our architecture always remain in a sensible state. Let me share some examples:\nRegardless of who moved what files and when, we want to make sure that your file trees never have any cycles.\nNo folder should have two files with the same name. Creating files, renaming files, and moving files could cause two files in a given location to share a name.\nActions that change a file's path or sharees could change how our cryptography algorithms search for a file's decryption key, we want to make sure for the total domain of actions your files are always decryptable by you.\nAs we used our platform we've collected many such validations that we want to ensure never occur for the global set of actions on our platform, and the fuzzer's job is to spit out test cases that violate these constraints. It does this by enumerating all the (significant) actions a user can take on the platform across N devices and with M collaborators. It randomly selects from this space and at each step it asks all parts of our system to make sure everything is still as it should be. It does this process in parallel fully utilizing a given machine's parallel computational resources. It travels through the search space in a manner that limits the amount of recomputation of known good states, fully utilizing a given machine's memory.\nGenerally when people say they're fuzzing, they mean handing a given function or user input randomized input to try to produce a failure. Our fuzzer captures that spirit of this but is different enough that plenty of people have raised an eyebrow when I told them we call this process fuzzing. Unfortunately test simulator isn't as cool a name, knowing what this process is now, if you can think of a cool name, do tell us.\nToday our highly optimized fuzzer executes close to 10,000 of these trials per second, however initially it was just a quick experiment I threw together to gain confidence in an early version of sync. This was written when we were still using an architecture that used docker-compose to spin up nginx, postgres, and pgbouncer locally. The fuzzer almost immediately found some bugs. We fixed these bugs, and the value of the fuzzer was made apparent to us. The time between defects started to grow and so did the intricacies of the bugs the fuzzer revealed. As a background task, we continued to invest in the implementation of the fuzzer, and the hardware it ran on. As our architecture became faster, so did the fuzzer alongside it. Today the fuzzer has been running continuously for months and has verified 10s of billions of user actions, a promising sign as we get ready to begin marketing our product.\nBelow are some of the fuzzer's key milestones. If you're interested in browsing the most recent implementation you can find it linked here.\n15 Trials Per Second\nInitially, we were running the fuzzer on our development machines, kicking it off overnight after any large change. Our first big jump in performance came from deciding to run it on a dedicated machine and trying to fully utilize that machine's computational resources.\n80 Trials Per Second\nWe first tried running our fuzzer on a dedicated server which had 80 vcpus. We purchased this machine for $600 in 2020. Most of our early optimization efforts centered around tuning Postgres to perform better.\n250 Trials Per Second\nOur next largest jump in performance was when we made the switch from Postgres to Redis, and upgraded the hardware that the fuzzer runs on. After 2 years of faithful service, our Poweredge experienced a hardware failure which we weren't motivated enough to diagnose. So in 2022 we pooled our resources for a 3990X Threadripper with 120 vCPUs.\n900 Trials Per Second\nBefore [db-rs] there was [hmdb] which was similar in values to db-rs, but worse in execution. It still served our needs better than Redis and performed better as it was embedded in the process rather than something that communicated over the network. It additionally used a vastly more performant serialization protocol across the whole stack, inside [core] and our server.\n4000 Trials Per Second\nIn late 2022 I wrote created a compile-time flag in [core] which allowed us to directly compile the entire server into core during test mode. This meant that instead of executing network calls for fetching documents and updates core was directly calling the corresponding server functions. At this point, no part of our test harness was using the network stack\n10,000 Trials per second\nOnce db-rs was fully integrated into core and server, I added a feature to db-rs called no-io, which allowed core and server to enter a \"volatile\" mode for testing. This also allowed instances of core and server, and their corresponding databases to be deep copied. So when a trial ran, if most of the trial had been executed by another worker, it would deep copy that trial's state and pick up where it left off.\nFuture of the fuzzer\nPersonally, the fuzzer has been one of the most interesting pieces of software I've worked on.

I'm going to start with the steering wheel, then I'll replace the seats, and finally I'll rebuild the shifter assembly.\n\nSteering wheel\nPresently, as I drive, the steering wheel deposits 25 year old leather crumbs into my hand. Let's try to replace it with something newer. I disconnected my battery so the airbag wouldn't deploy as I removed the old steering wheel.\n\nOut came the old wheel, and in went an NRG quick release hub.\n\nThis hub allows the driver to detach the steering wheel prior to getting out of the car. The Miata is a small car, and once a race seat is fitted there will be limited thigh-room. Having the option to remove the wheel makes it easier to get in and out.\n\nThe final diameter of the steering wheel is much smaller which results in a sharper handling feel.\nSeat\nNext up is the seat: the current seat is torn in a few places. Additionally, it doesn't provide much support when cornering hard. Ultimately this car will have a 4 point harness and at that point changing the seat won't be optional.\nI grabbed a pair of Sparco Sprint seats, with some Sparco mounting brackets. The Sparco Sprint seats fit in the NA Miata without having to modify the door cards or hammer in the transmission tunnel. Commonly, people will mount the seat directly to the car and give up the ability to adjust their seat. I want other people to be able to drive this car so I chose to mount the seat on the stock sliders.\n\nI cleaned out and regreased the slider. After a mild amount of cutting and persuasion the seats were attached to the mounting brackets, and the mounting brackets were bolted to the sliders.\n\nThese seats are track oriented bucket seats. They provide strong side bostering to hold you in place when you're cornering hard. Donut media illustrated the difference between most stock seats and bucket seats in this video (jump to the end to see how bucket seats perform).\n\nI'm not sure exactly what classes I'll be competing in long term, but thankfully these seats are FIA certified until 2028, which provides me with a large amount of flexibility.\nShifter assembly\nLike the steering wheel, the shifter knob disentegrates everytime I glance at it. The knob presently rotates freely, and heat radiates from the leather boot which is torn.\n\nI disassembled the entire shifter assembly, finding every layer to be in bad shape along the way. I also found Teflon tape under the universal shift knob.\n\n\nIn the shifter assembly there's nylon bushings which degrade over time, I grabbed a shifter rebuild kit and replaced all the nylon pieces.\n\nThis made the shfiter feel more precise and notchy. I also replaced all the rubber boots, and added fresh heat insulation. Because of the rebuild and the transmission service we performed earlier, the shifter now feels like it did 25 years ago.\n\n\nWith these 3 changes the interior is starting to be a very pleasant place to be.\nOutstanding items\n\nOur windshield has a big chip in it.\nOil change, and fuel filter replacement.\nDriver's side mirror wobbles a lot.\nTo race, we need a roll bar in many classes, and a 4 point harness in some classes.\nThere's a vibration at 85+mph. And there's a squeal during deceleration. I suspect the driveshaft.\nThe stock suspension is very soft, I plan to install adjustable track oriented suspension and install harder polyurethane bushings in place of the 25 year old rubber bushings - the inherent softness of rubber has not been helped by age.\nThe speakers sound very bad, and the head unit decides to beep a strange Sony theme song as a goodbye every time the car turns off.\nThe windows move very slowly.\nThe prior owner broke his key in the ignition, and as a fix decided to replace just the ignition assembly without changing the other locks in the car. So the car has 1 set of keys for the doors and a separate key for the ignition.\nThe brakes fade very quickly, the pads and fluid may be at the end of their life. But it's common to just upgrade to Flyin' Miata's Big Brake Kit for a larger thermal capacity.\nOnce all of these issues are sorted out, we'll embark on the journey of making more power.\n\n","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/updating-the-interior/","title":"Updating the Interior."},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/what-you-see/":{"body":"I've been giving a lot of thought to the various ways people view problems and solutions, particularly: how does what you spend most of your time doing map to the way you view the world? For example, people who spend a lot of time thinking about marketing and sales may have the following perspective: all the problems and solutions are out there; the hard part is creating a narrative that connects the dots. On the other hand, I would wager that people in finance see things in terms of accurate pricing, forecasting, and resource allocation.\nOf course, the thing that influences your perspective doesn't have to be tied to your profession (or any profession for that matter), but it likely does need to be tied to whatever you're putting your 10,000 hours into. I think this starts to happen somewhere around the time you consider the thing to be a central part of your identity. It's likely tied to the point where you start to form your own opinions using expertise and specific knowledge that other people don't have. At this point, you're in a position to contribute something novel back, hopefully something of value.\nPersonally, I'm very interested in putting my 10,000 hours towards advancing the state of technology. I find advancing technology (particularly writing software) to be intrinsically rewarding, I'd happily do this in a vacuum. However we're not a vacuum, and while every problem is not technical in nature, I see many that are.\nNow, I haven't crossed hour 10,000 yet, but I'm ready to start sharing my ideas and the way I think about certain things. I've learned a lot so far and I've formed a more clear idea of the type of technology I'm interested in advancing: technology that empowers the individual.\nI want to use this blog to detail the things I'm exploring, share what I value and the potential I see in the future.\n","id":"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/what-you-see/","title":"What you do is how you see."},"https://parth.github.io/parth.cafe/windshield-repair/":{"body":"Windshield Repair, Faster Windows, and More\nThis weekend we're going to knock out some non-glamorous maintainence items:\n\nAddress the chip in the windshield\nMake the window go up and down faster\nChange the fuel filter and oil\n\nWindshield chip\nWhile I was driving on the highway a rock flew up and hit my windshield. I considered having Safelight repair it. So far I've figured out how to do everything on a car myself, so I was curious if I could do this as well. I compared a few windshield repair kits I went for one from Permatex.\n\nThe process involved using the syringes and the pedestal  included in the kit to inject a resin into the damaged area. This damage is probably towards the extreme edge of what this kit can handle, so I don't expect perfection. I'd just like it to be less distracting and less likely to grow into a larger problem.\n\n\n\nOverall this went pretty well. It's not flawless and you can spot it if you know what you're looking for. But it's very easy to register it as a smudge and ignore it. On a smaller chip I think the results would be closer to perfect.\nWindow speed\nIt takes almost 20 seconds for my passenger window to roll up and down, and it takes about 15 seconds for the drivers side. And so, into the door we go to see what's going on. If everything is intact, we'll just clean and lubricate the path the window takes. If anything is broken I expect it to be the window bushings. So before I got started I grabbed a set of replacements just in case.\n\nMy dad and I pealed back the layers of the door, and on the drivers side just cleaning and lubricating was all we had to do. Doing this brought down the window travel time to 5 seconds. On the passenger side when we pulled out the window we saw that a bushing was missing.\n\nAt the bottom of the door we saw the many pieces that used to make up the old bushing. I fished them out while my dad applied the new bushing. Like the driver's side we cleaned and greased the rails. Once the door was back together the window went down in 5 seconds like the driver's side. Success!\nGetting into the door was a bit of a hassle, mainly due to the vapor barrier that's adhered to the door. Unfortunately, looking at our outstanding issues, this won't be the last time we have to get in here.\nOther maintainence\nI got a new Bosch  fuel filter.\nA pretty straightforward procedure, but I'm not sure it's possible to do without getting gasoline on yourself.\n\nWhen I went to change the engine oil, I found that the old oil filter was surprisingly difficult to remove on a car that's otherwise been very easy to work on. Always a bummer when you have to wait for a tool to show up to complete a job. But ultimately, with the new tool, the old oil was drained, and a round of fresh oil was poured. I used an oil filter with a nut on top just to give me another option for removal in the future.\n\n\nOutstanding items\n\nOur windshield has a big chip in it.\nOil change, and fuel filter replacement.\nDriver's side mirror wobbles a lot.\nTo race, we need a roll bar in many classes, and a 4 point harness in some classes.\nThere's a vibration at 85+mph.
